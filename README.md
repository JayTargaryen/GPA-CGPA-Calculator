Here's the format you need to use whenever you're going to add a file.
The first line should be the total number of semesters you're inputing.
From there, you're going to break up the informations into semesters.
The first line will be the semester number. For Example: "Semester 1"
The second line is the term. For example: "Fall 2016"
The third line is the number of courses in the current semester.
From here you're going to break up the information into courses.
The first line will be the course name.
The second line will be the grade earned in the class i.e. from A-F.
The third and final line will be the credit hours the course is worth.
